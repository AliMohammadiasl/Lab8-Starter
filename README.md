How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation is the practice of designing a website or web app to function properly on older or less capable browsers, while still taking advantage of modern features on newer browsers. Service workers, on the other hand, are a type of web technology that allow us to create offline experiences and improve performance by caching resources. By using service workers, we can implement graceful degradation strategies by selectively caching and serving different versions of our website or application based on the capabilities of the user's browser.
